<b>Improvements:</b>
- All vehicles sped up

<b>Bugfixes:</b>
- Fixed switching to bombs potentially causing crash

- Wind updates direction correctly
- Fixed bug where external/chase camera would sometimes look at nothing
- Fixed very old bug where landing gear didn't make noise when rolling
- Clouds blow in the same speed/direction as the wind

- Misplaced stores won't crash the game anymore
- Fixed F-5E not having correctly mirrored stores
- Building and object shadows no longer overlap in a weird way
- Missiles unlock when radar unlocks
- Updated Shapes library to fix flickering across various HUD elements
- Partial fix to cockpit jitter when rolling (still needs full fix)
- Shadows no longer drawn on top of vehicles when viewed from large distances

<b>0.6.1.0 (June 6 2021)</b>
- Major revision to how strategic target symbology is drawn (looks same, should be less error prone)
- Ground vehicle are difficult to target with IR guided weapons
- Formation icons use short name of formation
- Fixed bug where ejected pilots caused targeting errors
- Tweaked ejecting pilot and parachute physics
- Ejected pilots affected by wind
- Ejected pilots are named after their factions
- Formation icons now reflect their unit type (e.g. armor, AAA, etc)
- AI are much more adverse to flying low in an effort to prevent ground collisions
- Ejection sequence sped up for two seater aircraft
- Added AIM-7 series missiles (AIM-7E, AIM-7F)
- Added R-23 series missiles (R-23R, R-23T, R-24R, R-24T)
- All air to air missiles use a proximity fuze and splash damage instead of impact damage
- Aircraft more difficult to lock onto from the front
- Added F-4E and MiG-23MLA
- Support for swing wing AI aircraft
- HUD symbology for radar guided missiles
- Added the radar guided AIM-9C
- Semi-active radar homing missiles track only what the radar is currently locked onto
- Pass on all the missiles to ensure they track the correct signatures
- Fixed misaligned flame effect on missile motor staged ignition
- Renamed AIM-9M to AIM-9L
- Weapons can be attached by normal attach, or hardpoint specific attach (used for AIM-7)
- Database shows more information for munition guidance
- Far clip distance increased so fog effect appears correctly
- Fixed occasional crash when a formation is destoryed
- Camera falls back on free camera if uninitialized
- Distant aircraft have specifically colored dots ~2 pixels large
- "Air superiority" loadout of AV8B features two AIM-7Es
- Fixed bug where sometimes shooting the island would result in "hard" hit effects instead of "soft"
- Radar HUD display switched to B-Scope style display
